## `%macro_variable_shutter_chance()` macro <a name="macrovariableshutterchance-macros-1"></a> ######

Program Name    : %macro_variable_shutter_chance
 Description     : 
     This macro displays the current macro variables grouped by their scope
     (GLOBAL, LOCAL, AUTOMATIC) in a formatted SAS RWI(report Writing Interface) ods layout.
     It is primarily intended for debugging or reporting the macro environment
     during runtime. Output layout varies depending on the presence of automatic
     variables as specified by the parameter.

 Parameters      :
     CheckID        = [optional] Identifier string used to distinguish the ODS output 
                            for each macro call. If not provided, defaults to &SYSINDEX.

     automatic_fl   = [optional] Flag to include AUTOMATIC scope variables. 
                      Accepts 'Y' or 'N'. Default is 'N'.

 Features        :
     - Uses SASHELP.VMACRO to retrieve macro variables by scope
     - Hash objects and iterators used for efficient processing
     - Outputs results using the ODS OUT interface
     - Supports multiple executions with unique output regions

 Usage Example   :
     %let mvar1=A;
     %let mvar2=B;
     %macro_variable_shutter_chance(CheckID=A);

     %macro test;
         %global mvar2;
         %let mvar1=D;
         %let mvar2=E;
         %let mvar4=F;
         %do i = 1 %to 2;
             %put &i;
             %macro_variable_shutter_chance(CheckID=B);
             %if &i=1 %then %do;
                 data _null_;
                     call symputx("mvar3","G","L");
                 run;
             %end;
         %end;
     %mend;
     %test;

 Notes and Caveats:
     - This macro intentionally masks its own local macro variables from being 
       reported in the LOCAL scope output. This prevents internal implementation 
       details from appearing in the diagnostics.
        scope ne "MACRO_VARIABLE_SHUTTER_CHANCE"
        In other words, scope ne "MACRO_VARIABLE_SHUTTER_CHANCE2 is included in the extraction.  

     - Some AUTOMATIC macro variables may reflect values that were populated or 
       modified as a result of this macro�fs own execution (e.g., SYSLAST, SYSERR,  
       SYSINDEX, etc.). Their presence or contents should be interpreted accordingly.

## `%shutter_chance()` macro <a name="shutterchance-macros-2"></a> ######

MACRO NAME   : shutter_chance

Description  : This macro generates a visual checkpoint output for selected records

(based on _N_　or conditional expression) using ODS layout and table constructs. It is useful for

data review or debugging by presenting variable values in a clear format.

Parameters      :

CheckID  = Optional identifier for the output block. If not specified, &sysindex is used.

n        = Record numbers (_N_) to trigger output generation (e.g., 1:3 or 2 4 6). Default is 1.

if_condition  = Logical expression evaluated per observation (e.g., SEX='F' and AGE=15).

Cannot be used together with n.

varlist  = List of variable names to be displayed (space-delimited). This is required.

OUTPUT        :

When either _N_ matches the values in `n` **or** the `if_condition` evaluates to true,

the macro produces an ODS layout showing the CheckID, current _N_, and values of the

specified variables. Requires ODS output environment (e.g., HTML or RTF) to be active.

USAGE EXAMPLE:

data wk1;

set sashelp.class;

%shutter_chance(CheckID=A, n=1:3, varlist=Name Weight Height BMI);

BMI = Weight / HEIGHT**2 * 703;

%shutter_chance(CheckID=B, n=1:3, varlist=Name Weight Height BMI);

%shutter_chance(CheckID=C, if_condition=%nrbquote(SEX = "F" and AGE=15), varlist=Name Weight Height BMI);

run;

NOTES        :

- This macro internally creates an ODSOUT instance. Ensure ODS output is enabled.

- Variable names must be valid and exist in the dataset at the time of macro invocation.

- Avoid instance name conflicts if other ODS macros/templates are used.
